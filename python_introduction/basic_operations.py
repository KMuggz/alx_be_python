"""
    Objective:
    To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

    Task Description:
    Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
    Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
    Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.

    Instructions:
    Create a file named basic_operations.py.
    In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
    You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
    Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
    Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].

    Expected Output:
    When executed, your script should print the following (assuming number1 = 10 and number2 = 5):
"""
# This is a basic script that does some arithmetic operations
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Addition
sum_result = number1 + number2

# Subtraction
difference_result = number1 - number2

# Multiplication
product_result = number1 * number2

print(f'Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}')
print(f'Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}')
print(f'Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}')

# Expected Output: Successful execution with printed results
